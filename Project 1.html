<h1>The Best Movies/T.V. series according to DIVYANSH PANDEY:-</h1>

<h2>My top 3 recommendations of all time:</h2>

<hr><hr>

<h3>The Avengers series=></h3>
Main banger is the acting of Robert Downey Jr. as IronMan.<br>
The movie is a must watch for all the Marvel fans out there.<br>

<h3>Lucifer (on netflix )=></h3>
The only title after which I started to develop some curiosity and love for netflix shows. Absolutely a great mixture of all emotions combined. <br>

<h3>The Witcher ( also on netflix )=></h3>
Not the first time Henry Cavil impressed me, after the superman, the only person fit for becoming the wolf. <br>

<h5>These are all must watch. They are too good to ignore.</h5><br>
